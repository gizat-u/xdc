Agreement:

This is an agreement between you, the purchaser and licensee, and me, Slava Antipov. By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using the digital typeface software (hereafter ‘fonts’), you accept the terms of this agreement.

1. By purchasing the licence, you become a licensed user, not an owner, of the fonts. To ‘purchase a font’ is simply to purchase a license to use it in accordance with this agreement. Slava Antipov retains all copyrights to the fonts after purchase.

2. You may not sell, lease, sublicense, or otherwise assign or transfer any rights, duties or obligations under this agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or third-party, including by merger.

3. You may not distribute, lend, rent out, sell, give away, or share the font files for any reason not stated in this agreement. 

4. You are not permitted to modify the fonts  using font manipulation software to create a usable font without first gaining the express written permission of Slava Antipov to do so.

5. Licences are non-transferrable; the licensee is fixed at the time of purchase. As such, you may not transfer licences to clients once work utilising the fonts has been completed; the client must hold their own license to use the fonts, purchased either by them, or by you on their behalf.

6. Slava Antipov takes no responsibility for damage caused to a user’s hardware, software or a loss of income that may have occurred as a result of downloading, installing or using Slava Antipov fonts. All Slava Antipov fonts are installed are used entirely at the owner’s own risk and Slava Antipov cannot be held responsible.

7. Any breach of the terms of this agreement will immediately terminate your license to use the fonts. After termination of the license you must destroy any copies of the fonts in your possession.
